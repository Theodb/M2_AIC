A simple sample project.

There are two directories in this repository:

- notebooks: Contains two IPython notebooks containing a tutorial for Python
  packaging. They are both identical, except the simcluster-windows notebook
  contains more Windows-specific provisions.  If using Windows, the
  simcluster-windows notebook is recommended, but can otherwise be ignored.

- sample-project: This is a working copy of the project that is produced if
  working through one of the above notebooks successfully.  If you get lost in
  the notebook or mess something up you can always experiment with the sample
  project.

  The sample project also includes a tiny test suite that is not currently
  included in the main tutorial.
